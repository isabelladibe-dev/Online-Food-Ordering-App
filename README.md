# Online-Food-Ordering-App

## Overview
This project is a **front-end prototype** of an online food ordering application, featuring a mock login page and a dynamic Korean restaurant menu. It demonstrates my ability to build responsive web interfaces, work with JSON data, and implement interactive UI elements using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Key Features

- **Login Page (Mock)** – Simple, styled login form with feedback alert on submission.
- **Dynamic Menu** – Displays Korean dishes dynamically from a JSON file with name, description, and price.
- **Interactive Buttons** – “Add to Cart” buttons for each menu item simulate adding items to a cart and provide user feedback.
- **Responsive Design** – Grid layout adapts to different screen sizes using TailwindCSS.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation & JSON fetching)
- JSON for menu data storage
- TailwindCSS for responsive styling

---

## How It Works

1. `login.html` shows a mock login form; clicking “Login” triggers a confirmation alert.
2. `index.html` loads menu items from `menu.json` dynamically.
3. Each menu item has an “Add to Cart” button that simulates adding an item and logs it to the console.
4. The layout adjusts seamlessly for different screen sizes, showing multiple items in a responsive grid.
